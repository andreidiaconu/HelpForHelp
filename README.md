# HelpForHelp
Help a neighbour in need. Get points. Spend them by asking for help.

We all need help from time to time. Last week I had a flat tire and didn't know how to change it. I called a friend of mine and he helped me out. I was lucky to have a friend that knew how to change a tire and also had time for me.
This got me thinking! We are surrounded by people that can help us out in need and we ourselves can help a lot of people when we have time. We want to create an application that creates incentives for people to help out and make social involvement easier.

How the system works:
Anna wants help with her groceries. She creates a Help Request and offers a reward of 10 points for whoever helps her. Mark thinks 10 points for groceries sounds good, so he offers to help. At the end of the process, Anna and Mark offer each other brief reviews and Mark receives 10 points.
Mark needs help moving some furniture. He now has 10 points available to spend on a new Help Request.

The review system is similar to that from AirBnb, so people can feel free to be honest.
Users get a number of points as a bonus when they first create their account.  A complex achievement system can give users even more points for helping others. This all leads to people getting involved in helping others.

People with disabilities will get unlimited points to spend. This way the community will end up helping people who need it most.
The overall effect will be that people are more helpful and everyone feels more connected to their local community.
